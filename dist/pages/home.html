    <h3 class="c-charcoal margin-top--2x">Milestones and Calendar</h3>

    <p>Once the overall scope and end-date of your project has been determined, we will create a calendar in Basecamp with key milestones and delivery dates. Note that this is a working calendar, and that milestones may change over the course of your project as requirements shift or major decisions are made. This flexibility is important, and allows us to respond to new information while keeping the overall timeline and budget for your project on track.</p>

    <h3 class="c-charcoal margin-top--2x">Defining Scope</h3>

    <p>We will work with you during the discovery phase to identify the functionality that will be included in your project. To do this we will communicate features in terms of “user stories,” which are helpful for clarifying key actions that your users should be able to take on your site or app. An example of a user story might be “user can bookmark a video and come back to it later” or “logged- in user can post comments to blog posts”. There is often some adjustment that occurs between the initial project estimate and a more detailed scope based on user stories. Furthermore, user stories are likely to continue to change if a rapid prototyping and testing approach is chosen. We will work closely with you to ensure that the agreed upon scope aligns with the mission and meaning of your project, and will offer guidance in prioritizing the items that most directly support your vision.</p>
