    <h3 class="play-section-head">Milestones and Calendar</h3>

    <p>Once the overall scope and end-date of your project has been determined, we will create a calendar in Basecamp with key milestones and delivery dates. Note that this is a working calendar, and that milestones may change over the course of your project as requirements shift or major decisions are made. This flexibility is important, and allows us to respond to new information while keeping the overall timeline and budget for your project on track.</p>

    <h3 class="play-section-head">Defining Scope</h3>

    <p>We will work with you during the discovery phase to identify the functionality that will be included in your project. To do this we will communicate features in terms of “user stories,” which are helpful for clarifying key actions that your users should be able to take on your site or app. An example of a user story might be “user can bookmark a video and come back to it later” or “logged- in user can post comments to blog posts”. There is often some adjustment that occurs between the initial project estimate and a more detailed scope based on user stories. Furthermore, user stories are likely to continue to change if a rapid prototyping and testing approach is chosen. We will work closely with you to ensure that the agreed upon scope aligns with the mission and meaning of your project, and will offer guidance in prioritizing the items that most directly support your vision.</p>

      <p class="delta">In this section we’ve mapped out some common project components in order to help you understand the key activities and deliverables that you can expect at each stage of our collaboration. </p>

      <p>Not every project includes every component, so make sure that you clearly understand which of these will apply to you. These phases may happen concurrently or iteratively, so their order here does not necessarily reflect the order in which they occur.</p>
    </section>

    <h3 class="play-section-head">Discovery</h3>

    <p>The purpose of the discovery phase is to develop a deep understanding of the values and goals that will guide your project, and ultimately to create a shared definition of success. This phase is important because the information gathered during discovery often provides the direction for other phases of the project. It is an opportunity to bring untested assumptions to the surface, ask questions, collect and review existing data, understand your organization’s vision and values, clarify primary objectives, and examine your user’s needs. During discovery we will work closely with you to develop a set of user stories (features) and guiding principles that capture the essence of your vision while fitting within your budget. We will also develop an initial project roadmap which will include major milestones and delivery dates.</p>

    <h3 class="play-section-head">User Research</h3>

    <p>During the prior discovery process we will help you to identify key user-related questions that directly impact the design of your app or site. We will then recommend and implement specific user research tactics to generate insight into those questions, and develop “data-driven empathy” for your user’s needs and behaviors. The insights generated during user research act as a powerful foundation for design-related decisions made later in the project.</p>
